# testPlugin

This is a practice module using the awesome https://www.drupal.org/project/ckeditor5_embedded_content module is a starting point.
It is a learning experience to help build knowledge and understanding on how to build complex Ckeditor5 plugins.

This module copies all the CKeditor5-Embedded-Content code into a module named testPlugin and renames all the necessary Drupal files accordingly.
The new module is then edited for the purpose of learning how to create a functioning custom Ckeditor5 plugin module.
